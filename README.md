# CSCI 4022 - An Analysis of Boulder's Tree Population

## Question of interest
The city of Boulder is home to hundreds of trees of varying species. As with any population, some of these trees are in better condition than others.  We aim to investigate what factors most affect the health of Boulder's trees. This has the potential to yield some interesting results what trees do best or worst in Boulder.  For example, are certain types of trees the healthiest?  Or are trees that grow in certain locations the healthiest?  Or does some combination of these factors yield the healthiest trees?

## Dataset ([link](https://web.archive.org/web/20170428050251/https://bouldercolorado.gov/open-data/city-of-boulder-public-trees/))
We used the 2015 version of the Boulder Public Trees dataset.  This dataset contains information about the location and type of trees in the city of Boulder.  We are using this version instead of the most recent version because it also contains information about the condition of the trees.  The condition takes on one of six values (dead, very poor, poor, fair, good, and excellent) which we will represent as a scale from 1 to 6.
